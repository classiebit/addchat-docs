<a name="Technical-Specification"></a>
## Technical Specification

AddChat is very light, high performance, scalable and secure.

1. AddChat front-end built with **VueJs**, which is purely API based web-app.

2. AddChat back-end (API) built with **Laravel** & **CodeIgniter** (two seperate products) 

    - **AddChat Laravel** version is a Laravel package, hence, can be installed via **Composer** in an existing or a fresh Laravel website.

    - **AddChat Codeigniter** version comes with an installer, which auto-install AddChat in an existing or a fresh Codeigniter website



<a name="User-Interface-Design"></a>
## User Interface & Design

AddChat is designed in **CSS Flexbox** and **Sass**. Let's see what's so special about **CSS Flexbox** and why we used it.

1. AddChat is a CSS Framework Independent. Means, no matter in which CSS Framework your website is in, it neither affects the website CSS nor gets affected by it.

    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) 
    - [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) 
    - [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) 
    - [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) 
    - [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) 

    or any other...

2. AddChat CSS is completely encapsulated (wrapped in AddChat wrapper with `#addchat-bot .c-` prefix).
    - Hence, it never override your website CSS nor inherits from it.

    - AddChat UI is extra-responsive. Optimized for **extra-small** devices to large **4K desktops** -

        * Small phones
        * Android Phones
        * iPhones
        * iPad & iPad Pro0
        * Small-Medium Size Laptops
        * Large Desktops

3. We've used the popular **NPM** package `auto-prefixer` to make the AddChat UI design same across all types of browsers e.g `Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge` etc



<a name="Multi-regional"></a>
## Multi-regional

AddChat is compatible with all languages and timezones. AddChat auto adapts and adjust regional settings according to your website's default timezone and language. Please refer to the Language section for more info about **adding a new language** in [AddChat Laravel](/{{route}}/{{version}}/admin/multi-language-laravel) & [AddChat CodeIgniter](/{{route}}/{{version}}/admin/multi-language-codeigniter)

--- 

>{success} AddChat never breaks any of your website functionality, even if something went wrong with AddChat, there are `fallback modes` for every worst-case scenario.
